# Course-Registeration-System

The major task of this project is to store the students details and grades as well as the teacherâ€™s record of courses. The details must be provided for each and every section of the data fields, so that the system can store accurate information. There are three sections in this project i.e. they are the teachers, students, and an admin of the school.
Java programming language and Eclipse IDE are core elements. This project uses the MySQL database as backend support for storing the course registration information. In order to run this project, Eclipse IDE and XAMPP localhost server is required.
